## Problem
Finding and tracking books in libraries requires multiple manual steps:
- Searching library catalogs
- Recording call numbers and availability
- Maintaining organized search records
- Checking book status over time

This process is time-consuming and often leads to lost information.

## Solution
An AI assistant that automatically:
- **Searches** the Sunnyvale Public Library catalog (a home library) when you ask for a book
- **Finds** the book's call number and availability status
- **Saves** all the information to a Notion database called "Book Tracker"
  
Simply ask the assistant for any book, and it handles everything from search to storage automatically.

## Tech Stack
- **LangChain, LangGraph and LangGraph Studio**: Orchestrates the AI workflow, API toolings/routing and manages conversation flow with easy debugging.
- **Notion API**: Stores book information in a structured database
- **Webpage Parsing Library**: Extracts book details from library catalog pages
- **GPT-4o**: Powers natural language understanding and intelligent responses
### LangGraph Flow

## Results
